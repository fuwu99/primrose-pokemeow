## Battletower Bot Capabilities

This is an extra section made for people who are curious about what the Battletower Bot can do. 
#### Move selection
- It was already provided with a database consisting of all 140 pokemons that would be appearing in the battletower (As of May 18th 2023).
- In case the opponent's pokemon is not in the current database, it will automatically do api calls and search for the information on that specific pokemon.
- Automatically chooses the best move to use depending on type weakness of the opposing pokemon.
- Automatically caches the opponent's team info and plan the according moves.
- Custom wall pokemons database, which will cause the ally pokemon to use the highest damage-dealing move.
#### Automatic Switching
- The bot will automatically analyze the current matchup to find if the ally pokemon is in danger, or there are pokemons in the party that could handle the current opponent's pokemon better.
- If it's not switchable, the ally pokemon would use the highest damage-dealing move.
#### Automatic Forfeiting
- The bot will automatically forfeits if the user is on last pokemon, and the HP percentage/number is lower than the specified threshold.
- If you wanna be safe, make it always forfeit whenever reaching last pokemon (no risks).
#### Guarranteed Winrate (Tested)
- If you've got a good team with coverage, items, and pokemons that could deal with threats then the winrate could range from 57-59.
- Non-golden teams with items and good IVS still can achieve acceptable winrates ranging from 47(lowest)-55(highest).
- Just pray to god that you don't get bad G teams matchup, then everything's good.
#### Interface 
- Clean, viewable.
- The information displayed in the bot console is totally customizable, showing basically anything you want (ally's/opponent's stats, weaknesses, potential moveset, effective moves, moves used, health bars - pretty af,...).
## Documentation
Unreleased. Estimated release `31/5/2023`

## FAQ

#### Is it bannable? Detectable?

It's practically undectectable. No captcha risks at all just turn it on and go to sleep, but please don't do shits like these:
- Running the bot in OS, or any public grinding channels, that's obv W bigbrain move.
- Invite people to your private server where the bot logs all that shady stuff.
- And kids pls dont do fucking 5k catches daily or 3,360 battletower floors just to show off like a certain somebody...

#### Can it run on Mac / Ubuntu?

Well it can but IDK HOW TO SET IT UP ON THOSE PLATFORMS.

#### Can the captcha solver fail?

TL;DR: No. 
###### Wait maybe yes but only when:
- You get disconnected from the internet while solving a captcha.
- You shut down the bot, or your computer at the very wrong time.
- Your PC is undergoing a freeze.
- Your internet is UNIMAGINABLY SLOW, in this case pls consider not purchasing the bot at all.

#### What is the battletower bot capable of?

Read the extra section `Battletower Bot Capabilities` for info.

#### Why tf is the battletower bot so expensive?

You literally can make hundreds of millions pokecoins from special battletower golden, while you waste no sweat/time/sleep. That's a fair price imo.

#### Why remove battletower bot from sale soon?

It provides too much of an advantage to people who purchase this bot, this can't be made lightly. Thus only selling it exclusively to people who are early, might remove it in about two weeks time.

#### Why bot?

It's the game's fault for being boring, instead of spending precious hours of my time on the pointless bot I can just automate all of them. I'm only releasing this trying to find my way out of the game, but Ive gotta ruin the whole playerbase first.

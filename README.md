# Primrose Selfbot

## From 27/12/2023, this repository is archived and read-only, and I no longer accepts orders on Primrose.
- The rebranded version will come out on the 1st of Jan 2024 or sooner, and prices for the new bot will be temporarily discounted for a limited time
- All primrose clients will get a free update to the new bot, plus temporary discounts for new features.
- Thank you to all clients for supporting the bot for the past year! 

## Overview
A **feature-rich, advanced, performant PokÃ©Meow selfbot** that can make Meow devs cry
- This is **not free**, stop spamming my DMs.
- I am **not** responsible for any of your bans/loss/mistakes while using the bot.
- Scroll to the bottom for screenshots
- [!] The program doesn't use any external captcha solving services like 2captcha, saving alot of money in the long run. The captcha solver is muuuch more accurate than the external solving services too.

**Bundles content and prices have been changed as of V4 UPDATE**. Prices might be negotiable.

- If you share this Github repo to somebody else, **and a purchase is made by that person**, then you would get a **5% discount** from all your own purchases in the future.
- The Custom-made Battletower bot will probably **won't be on sale for long**.
- If you want me to add extra capabilities for the bot, or custom-made a part of the bot, please let me know! I'll be sure to share a helping hand, but it may cost you a little more! so... xd

## FAQ

#### Is it bannable? Detectable?

It's practically undectectable. No captcha risks at all just turn it on and go to sleep, but please don't do shits like these:
- Running the bot in OS, or any public grinding channels, that's obv W bigbrain move.
- Invite people to your private server where the bot logs all that shady stuff.
- And kids pls dont do fucking 5k catches daily or 3,360 battletower floors just to show off like a certain somebody...

#### Can it run on Mac / Ubuntu?

Well it can but IDK HOW TO SET IT UP ON THOSE PLATFORMS.

#### Can the captcha solver fail?

TL;DR: No. 
###### Wait maybe yes but only when:
- You get disconnected from the internet while solving a captcha.
- You shut down the bot, or your computer at the very wrong time.
- Your PC is undergoing a freeze.
- Your internet is UNIMAGINABLY SLOW, in this case pls consider not purchasing the bot at all.

#### What is the battletower bot capable of?

Read the extra section `Battletower Bot Capabilities` for info.

#### Why tf is the battletower bot so expensive?

You literally can make hundreds of millions pokecoins from special battletower golden, while you waste no sweat/time/sleep. That's a fair price imo.

#### Why remove battletower bot from sale soon?

It provides too much of an advantage to people who purchase this bot, this can't be made lightly. Thus only selling it exclusively to people who are early, might remove it in about some time.
